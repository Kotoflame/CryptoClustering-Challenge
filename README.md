# CryptoClustering-Challenge
Module 19 challenge UMN Data Bootcamp

Readme:
HW completed using in-class materials, with the primary addition being using the panel module (https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/index.html)

This is because I prefer to use Spyder's plugin for Jupyter over working in the standard Jupyter browser app. This means that I need to run a live server in order to use hvplot. Panel allows me to do this quite easily. 

Additionally, I did not use the + composite method, as I felt the comparison was better done with a grid plot from Panel.
